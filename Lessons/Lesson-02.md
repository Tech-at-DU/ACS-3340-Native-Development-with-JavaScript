## Why learn Redux? ü§î

<!-- > -->

ü§π‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Managing application state is an important part of app development. 

üë©‚Äçüî¨ Redux is an advanced tool for managing application state. 

üßë‚Äçüíª Redux is a professional level tool. 

<!-- > -->

Redux is an industry standard tool for managing application state. 

You should know it! 

<!-- > -->

## Redux Review

<!-- > -->

### Application State

Application state is the data your program manages.

<!-- > -->

This can be almost anything and everything.

- User data
- Content data 
- values that determine the state of the interface

<!-- > -->

### Actions üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

All changes to application state are handled by actions.

<!-- > -->

```JS
const NEW_TODO = 'NEW_TODO'
const DELETE_TODO = 'DELETE_TODO'

const newTodo = (name) => {
  ...
}

const deleteTodo = (index) => {
  ...
}
```

This will tell you what can changes can be made to your application state. 

_Changes can not be made without an action!_

<!-- > -->

An action has a type and might have a payload. 

```JS
const deleteTodo = (index) => {
  return {
    type: DELETE_TODO, // !!!! REQUIERED !!!!!
    payload: { index } // { index: 4 }
  }
}
```

_The payload contains any information need to make that change._ 

<!-- > -->

Looking at the actions will tell you what kinds of changes can be made in a Redux app.

üßê üîé

_State can only be changed through an action!_ 

<!-- > -->

Notice that actions don't actually make a change. 

ü§î

_An action is only the name and some values._

<!-- > -->

### Reducers ‚öôÔ∏è

Reducers are where changes occur. 

<!-- > -->

Your reducers handle changes by processing actions. üè≠

<!-- > -->

Every reducer is a function that takes state and an action. 

```JS
const todoReducer = (state = [], action) => {
  switch(action.type) {
    case NEW_TODO: 
      return [...state, action.payload]
    case DELETE_TODO: 
      const newState = state.filter((item, i) => {
        return i !==  action.payload.index 
      })
      return newState
    default: 
      return state
  }
}
```

<!-- > -->

A reducer is a function that: 

- Takes in state and an action object
- Makes changes to state
- Returns new state

state => new state

<!-- > -->

Reducers are also responsible for defining default state. 

```JS
const todoReducer = (state = [], action) => {
  ...
}
```

<!-- > -->

What is "new state"? 

A reducer must always copy state and return the copy! 

<!-- > -->

### The Store üéÅ

The store is where your data is stored.

<!-- > -->

The store is an object that stores your state values. 

<!-- > -->

You define the store when you `combineReducers`

```JS
export default combineReducers({
  todos: todosReducer
})
```

This determines the shape of the store/state. 

```JS
state = { todos }
```

<!-- > -->

The Reducer: 

```JS
const todoReducer = (state = [], action) => {
  ...
}
```

Root reducer

```JS
export default combineReducers({
  todos: todosReducer
})
```

State

```JS
const { todos } = useSelector(state => state) // []
```

<!-- > -->

For example: `

```JS
export default combineReducers({
  users: usersReducer,
	posts: postsReducer,
	options: optionsReducer
})
```

‚¨áÔ∏è

```JS
state = { users, posts, options }
```

<!-- > -->

## Build a todolist ‚úÖ

<!-- > -->

Get the [sample code](https://github.com/soggybag/redux-todo).

<!-- > -->

The starting application will: 

- make new todo items 
- remove todo items. 

<!-- > -->

Items are stored in Redux. 

`TodoList.js` component displays a list of `Todo.js` components. 

<!-- > -->

New Todo uses the [controlled pattern](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html). 

Use this with all form elements. 

<!-- > -->

### Organizing code üìê

<!-- > -->

The project contains several components organized in folders. 

- `App` : The main view of the project. 
- `todo-new` : creates a new todo with a name
- `todo-list` : Displays a list of `todo` items
- `todo` : Displays a single todo

Components that use more than one file are organized in folders. 

<!-- > -->

### App State

<!-- > -->

Here application state is an array of Objects. Each of these is an instance of `./components/TodoItem.js`.

<!-- > -->

Look at `./reducers/todos-reducer.js`. The reducer defines the initial state and how changes are made to state. 

<!-- > -->

Currently, there are two actions that are handled by this reducer: 

- `NEW_TODO`: adds a new todo item to the array
- `DELETE_TODO`: removes a todo item from the array

In both cases a new array is created and returned. 

**Important!** A reducer must always return new state! 

<!-- > -->

### App state only changes by sending actions

Application state can only be changed by sending actions.

<!-- > -->

`./actions/index.js`. 

This app defines two actions:

- `NEW_TODO`: adds a new todo item to the array
- `DELETE_TODO`: removes a todo item from the array

<!-- > -->

In this app you can only create a new todo item or delete an existing one. 

<!-- > -->

Every action string also has a coresponding action creator. This is a function that returns an object with a type and a payload. 

<!-- > -->

These action objects are what is sent to the reducer and are what the reducer uses to handle making changes to application state. 

<!-- > -->

#### Action types

<!-- > -->

The action type is a string. Defining this as a constant is best practice. This prevents errors are makes it easy to edit if needed. 

<!-- > -->

#### Action Payload

<!-- > -->

Some actions might require more data to accomplish its purpose. For example, creating a new todo item requires the name of the todo. 

<!-- > -->

To delete a todo you need the index of the todo item to be deleted. 

<!-- > -->

### Todo List challenges

Try these challenges to test your understanding of Redux. 

<!-- > -->

**Challenge 1** Display completed

Currently todos have the following properties: 

- name
- completed
- date

Only the name is currently displayed. Modify `./component/todo.js` to display the completed state. 

You can do this by adding a check mark or changing the color of text or background of this component.

<!-- > -->

**Challenge 2** Mark todos complete

Add a button to the `Todo` component that will mark a todo as completed. Follow these steps: 

- Add a new action `MARK_COMPLETE`
- Add an action creator function `markComplete`
	- Supply index of the todo as a parameter
	- It should also include the index in the payload
- Modify the `todosReducer.js` to handle this change. 
	- Import the action type
	- Add a new case for this type
	- Set the completed property of a the todo with the matching index

<!-- > -->

**Challenge 3** Mark all complete 

Make a new button that marks all todos complete.
