## Why Learn React? 

React is one of the most popular libraries around today. Seriously, you should know it! React is good to learn now since it has huge and well-deserved popularity.

Here is a good look at the reasons to learn React, Vue, or Angular.

Check out the state of JavaScript 2019:

Looks to me like it's a good time to learn React. That said, it won't be here forever and you are capable of learning any framework. React is a good place to invest your time right now.

## React Redux Review

<!-- > -->

React seems to be a popular tool, it can also be used to make native mobile applications. This makes it a good choice for this class. 

<!-- > -->

Native applications hold and manage their own data. We need a tool and a strategy for this! I'm going to propose Redux. You've used it before, it's mature and popular.

<!-- > -->

Let's answer a couple questions about redux.

Why use Redux? Is redux still used in 2021? Can't you replace Redux with one of those new hooks?

## Start the Reat Redux Tutorial

To get started you will work one of the React + Redux tutorials. There are three to choose from. You may have done one of these in the previous class, choose a different tutorial to complete for this assignment.

This is a review. Redux takes some practice to master doing another tutorial on the topic will solididfy your knowledge.
