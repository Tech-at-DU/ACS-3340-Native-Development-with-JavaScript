# ACS 3340

## Course Description

This course covers how JavaScript can be used to create native desktop and mobile applications for both Android and iOS. JavaScript provides a path to applications that have the ease of being cross platform and written in JavaScript while still benefiting most of the features of writing in the native language. Students will deepen their JavaScript knowledge and gain understanding where these JavaScript frameworks can and can not effectively replace native programming.

### Why you should know this

If your goal is to make the best possible user experiences and products having the ability to make truly native applications is a great tool to have in your arsenal. If you want to broaden your skill set out from the web adding native development is a good direction. If you want get a deeper understanding of the JavaScript language, and if you want to develop your programming knowledge by practicing with Reactive and functional programming concepts.

UPDATING



🔥 Updated Final Project (Modern + Challenging + Structured)

ACS 3340 – Final Project: Production-Ready Mobile App

Core Idea

Build a mobile app of your own design that demonstrates:
	•	Architecture
	•	State management
	•	Device integration
	•	UX thinking
	•	Data persistence
	•	Navigation structure

This should feel like something you could ship to the App Store.

⸻

✅ Updated Requirements (Stronger + More Meaningful)

Your app must include:

1️⃣ Navigation Architecture
	•	Bottom Tab Navigator (min 3 tabs)
	•	At least one nested Stack Navigator
	•	One modal screen or conditional route

⸻

2️⃣ State Management
	•	Redux Toolkit
	•	At least one async thunk
	•	Meaningful global state (not just a counter)

⸻

3️⃣ Data Layer

One of the following:
	•	Fetch data from a public API
	•	OR connect to your own backend
	•	OR simulate server with async storage + local persistence

Must include:
	•	Loading state
	•	Error state
	•	Refresh mechanism

⸻

4️⃣ Persistence
	•	Use AsyncStorage (or equivalent)
	•	Persist user settings or favorites
	•	Hydrate state on app launch

⸻

5️⃣ Device or Native Capability

Choose one:
	•	Camera
	•	Image picker
	•	Location
	•	Haptics
	•	Share API
	•	Notifications
	•	File system

This is where it becomes a real mobile app.

⸻

6️⃣ UI / Design System

One of:
	•	Use a component library with theming
	•	OR implement your own theme system
	•	Must support light/dark mode toggle

⸻

7️⃣ Animation

At least one:
	•	Animated list item
	•	Modal transition
	•	Button microinteraction
	•	Layout animation
	•	Reanimated usage (bonus)

⸻

📊 Updated Rubric (More Professional)

Category	Does Not Meet	Meets	Exceeds
Architecture	App is disorganized	Clear folder structure, separation of concerns	Feature-based architecture, reusable components
State Management	Redux used minimally	Proper slice structure + async logic	Clean thunks, selectors, memoization
UX & Design	Basic layout	Consistent spacing + theme	Thoughtful UX, animations, accessibility
Native Integration	None	One native API integrated	Well-integrated + permission handling
Persistence	None	Data persists correctly	Clean hydration + fallback handling
Code Quality	Errors / warnings	Clean and functional	Linted, formatted, structured
Development Process	Few commits	Regular commits	Clean commit history + clear iteration


⸻

🎯 Three-Week Plan With In-Class Demos

You need demos that spark ideas while teaching depth.

⸻

Week 1 – “Real Data + Persistence”

In-Class Demo:

Build a small “Favorites Explorer”

Features:
	•	Fetch data from an API (e.g. Dogs API, Pokemon API)
	•	Display in FlatList
	•	Add favorite
	•	Persist to AsyncStorage
	•	Hydrate on launch
	•	Add pull-to-refresh

This demo hits:
	•	Redux async thunks
	•	AsyncStorage
	•	List refresh
	•	Error/loading states

Then say:

Your final project needs this level of depth.

⸻

Week 2 – “Device Integration + UX”

In-Class Demo:

Build a “Photo Journal”

Features:
	•	Take a photo
	•	Save to local storage
	•	Display in list
	•	Add metadata
	•	Add animation when new photo appears

Teaches:
	•	Permissions
	•	Expo camera
	•	File system
	•	Animation
	•	Navigation between screens

This expands their thinking.

⸻

Week 3 – “Polish + Architecture”

In-Class Demo:

Refactor an ugly app into:
	•	Feature folders
	•	Reusable components
	•	Theme file
	•	Dark mode toggle
	•	Performance optimizations

This shows what professional polish looks like.

⸻

💡 Good Final Project Idea Prompts

Instead of vague suggestions, give structured prompts:
	•	Fitness Tracker
	•	Book Tracker
	•	Recipe Manager
	•	Travel Journal
	•	Mood Tracker
	•	Pet Adoption Browser
	•	Habit Tracker
	•	Movie Discovery App
	•	Event Planner
	•	Personal Finance Tracker

All must:
	•	Fetch or simulate data
	•	Persist data
	•	Include device feature

⸻

🚫 What to Remove

Remove:
	•	“Convert a tutorial”
	•	“Any idea is fine”
	•	Minimal navigation requirement

Students will default to easiest path.

⸻

🧠 Why This Matters

Right now your final project checks:
	•	Navigation
	•	Redux
	•	Lists

That’s midterm-level.

By the end of term they should demonstrate:
	•	Architecture
	•	Asynchronous logic
	•	Persistence
	•	Native capability
	•	UX thinking

That’s capstone-level.
